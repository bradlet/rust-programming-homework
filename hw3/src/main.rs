//! Command-line Chomp player  
//! Bradley Thompson and Bart Massey 2023
//!
//! This player repeatedly
//! * Displays the board
//! * Prompts the human for a move until a legal move is obtained
//! * Makes the human move on the board
//! * Displays the board
//! * Gets a winning computer move from the AI
//!   * If the AI has no winning move, chooses a computer move
//!     by going to the last available row and eating the last
//!     available square in that row
//! * Makes the computer move on the board
//! * Displays the computer move
//! This continues until the game is over,
//! at which point either "you lose" or "you win"
//! is printed depending on the outcome.
